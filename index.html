   <h4><font color ="purple">Doctors Appointment System</font></h4>
   <p>
I created a Doctors Appointment System that makes it easy for patients to schedule appointments with doctors. Using HTML and CSS, I built a simple and user-friendly website where patients can book, change, or cancel their appointments. The system uses SQL to safely store and retrieve appointment information and doctor schedules. This project helps improve the healthcare experience by making it faster and easier for patients to get the care they need.</p>

   <h4><font color ="purple">University Event management System</font></h4>
   <p>
I developed a University Event Management System using JavaFX, which allows students and staff to easily create, manage, and participate in events. The application features a user-friendly interface built with JavaFX, making it simple to navigate and access event details. I implemented Java code to handle tasks like event registration, notifications, and scheduling. This project helps streamline event planning and boosts student engagement in university activities.</p>
